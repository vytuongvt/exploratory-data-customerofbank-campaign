Employment variation rate**\n\nQuarterly indicator (numeric)\n\n**Emp.var.rate definition**: *Cyclical employment variation is essentially the variation of how many people are being hired or fired due to the shifts in the conditions of the economy. When the economy is in a recession or depression, people should be more conservative with their money and how the spend it because their financial future is less clear due to cyclical unemployment. When the economy is at its peak, individuals can be more open to risky investments because their employment options are greater (That means that the employment rate itself is not given but rather its variation.)*.\n\nEmployment variation rate varies from -3.4 till 1.4, here the mean is significantly lower than the median which means there are many negative values that impact the mean. \n\n- 39% of people were contacted when the rate was positive 1.4%;\n- 22% of people were contacted when the rate was negative 1.8%;\n- 19% of people were contacted when the rate was positive 1.1%\n\nIt seems logical that sales agents reached out during positive employment variation rate, however its not clear why they called when the rate was negative 1.8%\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df_v2['employment_variation_rate'].describe()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-01-20T22:16:27.396013Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-01-20T22:16:27.39649Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-01-20T22:16:27.41197Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-01-20T22:16:27.396444Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-01-20T22:16:27.410852Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"field=\"employment_variation_rate\"\nxlabel=\"Employment variation rate - quarterly indicator \"\nylabel=\"Count\"\n\nplot_field(df_v2, field, xlabel, ylabel)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-01-20T22:16:27.413332Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-01-20T22:16:27.413715Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-01-20T22:16:28.52269Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-01-20T22:16:27.413684Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-01-20T22:16:28.521Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**17.

Having a credit in default and Personal Loan can be a meaningul variable for the future sales campaign and **sales agents can save time by targeting the clients without defaults and personal loans**;\n2. **Sales agents should start the campaign in March, continue till the end of summer and wrap up towards November, before the holidays**. It should also be investigated internally why so many calls have been done in May.\n3. All macroeconomic indicators 'Employment Variation Rate', 'Consumer Confidence Index' and 'Consumer Price Index' are highly correlated. **This can impact the model because of multicollinearity and it will be required to remove some of them;**\n4. Among macroeconomic variables only Employment Variation Rate and Euribor Rate have enough variation and showed interesting patterns in visuals, other variables did not show any interesting correlations and  can be removed.\n5. 'Last Contact Duration' and 'Age': Population of clients who have subscribed are in higher threshold than clients who have not -> **selling deposits requires longer conversations**;\n6. 'Employment Varitation Rate' and 'Age': Clients subscribe during more turbulent labor market conditions when the employment varation rate was negative from -1 to -3 with heterogeneous age groups -> **sales agents should more actively engage in campaigns when the rate is negative/falling as the employment options narrow - clients are more motivated to save**;\n7. 'Euro Interbank Rate' and 'Age': More clients below 50 years old subscribed to deposits during beneficial times of higher interbank rates, heterogeneous age groups subscribed when the rate was from 1 to 2 ->**sales agents should more actively engage in campaigns when the rate is high**;\n8. 'Current Campaign Contact Count' and 'Last Contact Duration': There are two distinct populations of clients who were frequently contacted, more than 10 times and whose call duration was shorter that the second group, and the second group that subscribed was called less than 10 times and had longer conversations that -> **sales agents should not contact clients more than 10 times**;\n9. Job Categories by Subscription: Admin positions, blue-collars and technicians subscribed the most but they were also contacted and targeted the most; Students and retired subscribed proportionally more frequently despite of not being contacted many times -> **Students and retired should get a special attention in the next campaign**\n10. Clients with university degree, high school diploma and professional courses subscribed the most;\n11. **25-35, 35-45, 45-55 subscribed the most** as they were targeted the most; **Conversion of Under 25, Above 65 is high** despite of not being targeted widely;\n12. Above 8 minutes is the duration of call that converted the most customers; 4-6 minutes is the second by conversion -> **sales agents should have conversation plans and prompts that would be enough to hold a conversation for 6-8 minutes or longer.
